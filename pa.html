    <h2>section Two</h2>—Henry David Thoreau
    <p>
      Whether it's watching blue, rolling waves crash against the sandy shore or hearing birds chirping in a green,
      luscious forest, there is something so remarkable and beautiful about being immersed in nature. It’s easy to be
      swept away with today’s technology and fast-paced living, but no matter where you are, nature always has a way of
      bringing peace to the mind and grounding a person.

    <h2>Section Three</h2>About Nature
    <p>
      "The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the way.
      Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my propositions. And some see no
      nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself." William Blake
